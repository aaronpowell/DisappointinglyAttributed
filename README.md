Sometimes you're working on code which is just disappointing but there's no way which you can really convey that dissapointment to others in the code.

Never fear `DisappointinglyAttributed` is here!

```csharp
[ಠ_ಠ]
[ب_ب]
[ಥ_ಥ]
public static class Utility
{
    /* code here */
}
```

That's right, get some emoticons up on your code.

If you're using something like F# you can decorate the code even deeper:

```fsharp
[<``¯|_(ツ)_|¯``>]
[<``° ͜ʖ ͡°``>]
[<``(╯°□°）╯︵┻━┻``>]
[<``┬──┬ノ(゜-゜ノ)``>]
[<``(╯°□°)╯``>]
module Utilities =
    //stuff
```
